# ETH Research Focus

## Primary Narrative: DeFi Infrastructure / Ultrasound Money

Ethereum should be analyzed through the lens of:
- **DeFi Foundation**: Primary settlement layer for decentralized finance
- **Gas Economics**: Fee burn mechanism and supply dynamics
- **L2 Ecosystem**: Rollup adoption and blob fee revenue
- **Staking Yield**: Competitive yield vs TradFi alternatives
- **ETF Adoption**: Institutional access path (spot ETH ETFs)

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Executive Summary Emphasis
- Lead with network activity (gas usage, active addresses)
- Reference ETF flow momentum vs BTC ETF comparison
- Highlight L2 TVL growth and blob fee revenue
- Note staking rate and effective yield

### On-Chain Valuation Priority Metrics

**Tier 1 (Must Include):**
| Metric | Bullish | Neutral | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| MVRV Ratio | < 1.5 | 1.5-3.0 | > 3.5 |
| Gas Usage | Rising | Stable | Declining |
| Staking Rate | 25-35% | 15-25% | < 15% or > 40% |

**Tier 2 (Context):**
- Blob fee revenue (L2 data availability)
- DeFi TVL concentration
- NFT marketplace volume

**ETH-Specific Metrics:**
- Gas Price Trend: Network demand proxy
- ETH Burned (daily): Deflationary pressure
- Validator Queue: Staking demand indicator
- L2 TVL Growth: Ecosystem expansion

### Derivatives Positioning Focus

**Key ETH Considerations:**
- ETH/BTC ratio positioning (relative value)
- Staking yield vs funding rate arbitrage
- Options skew compared to BTC (risk appetite proxy)
- DeFi protocol liquidation levels

**Liquidation Analysis:**
- Watch DeFi lending liquidation levels (Aave, Compound)
- ETH often more volatile than BTC - cascade risk higher
- Merge/upgrade events create positioning imbalances

### Catalyst Analysis Priorities

**Near-Term:**
- Protocol upgrades (Dencun follow-ups, etc.)
- L2 token launches/airdrops
- Major DeFi protocol changes

**Medium-Term:**
- ETH ETF flow trajectory vs BTC
- Staking yield changes (validator economics)
- L2 competition dynamics

**Regulatory:**
- ETH staking classification (security risk)
- DeFi regulatory framework development
- ETF staking feature potential

### Valuation Model Anchors

**Bull Case Triggers:**
- Gas usage rising + L2 TVL growing + ETF inflows
- DeFi "summer" narrative revival
- Staking yield competitive with risk-free rate

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- Moderate network activity
- Neutral to slight ETF outflows (vs BTC preference)
- L2 growth continues but fees remain low

**Bear Case Triggers:**
- Network activity declining
- L2 migration reducing mainnet fees
- Regulatory classification as security
- Competition from alternative L1s

### Risk Assessment Specifics

**ETH-Specific Risks:**
1. **Staking Centralization**: Lido dominance concerns
2. **L2 Competition**: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism fragmenting ecosystem
3. **Security Classification**: SEC stance on staked ETH
4. **Gas Volatility**: Unpredictable fee economics
5. **Alt-L1 Competition**: Solana, etc. taking market share

**Invalidation Levels:**
- On-chain: Sustained declining active addresses
- Technical: ETH/BTC ratio breaking down below historical support
- Fundamental: DeFi TVL exodus to other chains

### Macro Context Priority

**ETH-Specific Correlations:**
- BTC: Primary correlation (risk-on/off proxy)
- ETH/BTC Ratio: Relative performance indicator
- DeFi TVL: Ecosystem health proxy
- Stablecoin Supply (USDC/USDT): DeFi liquidity

**Network Economics:**
- Fee burn rate (deflationary pressure)
- Validator economics (yield sustainability)
- L2 fee contribution

### Technical & Sentiment Specifics

**Key ETH Levels:**
- ETH/BTC ratio support/resistance
- Merge price level (psychological)
- Round numbers: $2K, $3K, $4K, $5K

**Sentiment Indicators:**
- DeFi pulse metrics
- NFT marketplace activity
- Developer activity (GitHub commits)

**Smart Money Signals:**
- Foundation wallet movements
- Major protocol treasury actions
- Institutional custody flows

## Comparable Assets Table

| Asset | Comparison Basis | Key Ratio |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| BTC | Risk-on/off beta | ETH/BTC ratio |
| SOL | L1 competition | TVL comparison |
| LINK | DeFi infrastructure | Oracle dependency |
| LDO | Staking proxy | Correlation |
