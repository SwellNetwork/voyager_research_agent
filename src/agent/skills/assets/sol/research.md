# SOL Research Focus

## Primary Narrative: High-Throughput L1 / Retail DeFi

Solana should be analyzed through the lens of:
- **Performance**: Highest TPS among major L1s, sub-second finality
- **Retail DeFi**: Meme coin activity, NFT marketplace, DEX volume
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Rust-based, growing developer adoption
- **Institutional Interest**: ETF filing momentum, institutional products
- **Network Reliability**: Outage history and improvements

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Executive Summary Emphasis
- Lead with network activity (TPS, active addresses, transactions)
- Reference DEX volume vs Ethereum comparison
- Highlight meme coin and NFT narrative health
- Note institutional product developments (ETF filings)

### On-Chain Valuation Priority Metrics

**Tier 1 (Must Include):**
| Metric | Bullish | Neutral | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Active Addresses | Rising | Stable | Declining |
| DEX Volume | Growing vs ETH | Stable | Losing share |
| Validator Count | Growing | Stable | Declining |

**Tier 2 (Context):**
- TVL growth rate
- NFT marketplace volume
- Stablecoin supply on Solana

**SOL-Specific Metrics:**
- TPS and Network Utilization
- Priority Fees (demand indicator)
- Stake-weighted QoS metrics
- Network uptime (outage tracking)

### Derivatives Positioning Focus

**Key SOL Considerations:**
- SOL/ETH ratio (L1 competition metric)
- Perps-to-spot volume ratio (speculative activity)
- Open interest relative to market cap (leverage risk)
- Meme coin correlation (retail sentiment proxy)

**Liquidation Analysis:**
- SOL has higher leverage ratios than BTC/ETH
- Meme coin cascades can affect SOL price
- Watch concentrated positions in Jupiter, Raydium liquidations

### Catalyst Analysis Priorities

**Near-Term:**
- Major dApp launches/updates
- Meme coin launches driving volume
- Network upgrade implementations

**Medium-Term:**
- ETF approval timeline
- Firedancer client launch (second validator client)
- Institutional custody solutions

**Regulatory:**
- SEC classification stance
- DeFi regulatory framework impact
- Staking product approvals

### Valuation Model Anchors

**Bull Case Triggers:**
- Network activity ATH + meme coin momentum + ETF approval
- Firedancer launch improving decentralization narrative
- DeFi/NFT "summer" on Solana

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- Moderate network activity
- Retail interest stable
- No major outages

**Bear Case Triggers:**
- Network outage/reliability issues
- Meme coin narrative exhaustion
- Competition from other L1s (Sui, Aptos, etc.)
- Regulatory adverse classification

### Risk Assessment Specifics

**SOL-Specific Risks:**
1. **Network Reliability**: Historical outage track record
2. **Validator Centralization**: Stake concentration concerns
3. **Meme Coin Dependency**: Retail narrative fragility
4. **Token Unlock Schedule**: Foundation/team token releases
5. **FTX Exposure**: Remaining unlocks from estate
6. **Regulatory Classification**: Security concerns

**Invalidation Levels:**
- On-chain: Network outage > 4 hours
- Technical: Loss of key support levels
- Fundamental: TVL exodus to other L1s

### Macro Context Priority

**SOL-Specific Correlations:**
- BTC: Primary risk-on/off correlation
- ETH: L1 competition dynamics
- Meme coins: Retail sentiment proxy
- Risk appetite: Higher beta to market sentiment

**Network Economics:**
- Fee revenue trends
- Validator economics
- Staking yield competitiveness

### Technical & Sentiment Specifics

**Key SOL Levels:**
- Previous ATH ($260)
- Round numbers: $100, $150, $200, $250
- FTX bankruptcy price levels

**Sentiment Indicators:**
- Meme coin launch activity
- NFT marketplace volume
- Developer activity metrics

**Smart Money Signals:**
- Foundation wallet movements
- Major ecosystem fund deployments
- Institutional custody announcements

## Comparable Assets Table

| Asset | Comparison Basis | Key Ratio |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| ETH | L1 competition | SOL/ETH ratio |
| AVAX | Alt-L1 peer | TVL comparison |
| APT/SUI | New L1 competition | Activity metrics |
| BONK | Meme coin proxy | Correlation |
