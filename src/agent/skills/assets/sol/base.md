# SOL Analysis Framework

## Asset Narrative

Solana: High-throughput L1, DeFi/NFT ecosystem, developer activity hub.

SOL is positioned as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum with:
- **High TPS**: 65,000+ theoretical transactions per second
- **Low Fees**: Sub-cent transaction costs
- **Growing Ecosystem**: DeFi, NFTs, consumer apps
- **Developer Traction**: Active builder community

## Primary Metrics

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **TPS** | Transactions per second | Network utilization |
| **DEX Volume** | Daily swap volume | DeFi activity |
| **TVL** | Total Value Locked | Capital in ecosystem |
| **NFT Volume** | NFT trading activity | Consumer adoption |
| **Active Addresses** | Daily unique users | Network growth |

## Valuation Model

### FDV/TVL Approach

| FDV/TVL | Classification |
|---------|----------------|
| > 10x | Overvalued relative to capital |
| 5-10x | Fair value |
| 2-5x | Undervalued |
| < 2x | Significantly undervalued |

### Comparable Analysis

| Metric | SOL | ETH | Comparison |
|--------|-----|-----|------------|
| TPS | 65,000 | ~30 | Higher throughput |
| Fees | <$0.01 | Variable | Lower cost |
| Decentralization | Lower | Higher | Tradeoff |

## Key Thresholds

### Network Health
- **Uptime Acceptable**: > 99%
- **TPS Healthy**: > 2,000 sustained
- **Stake Concentration**: < 33% top validators

### Growth Metrics
- **DEX Volume Growth Bullish**: > 15% MoM
- **TVL Growth Bullish**: > 10% MoM
- **Active Address Growth**: > 5% MoM

## Comparable Assets

| Asset | Comparison Basis |
|-------|------------------|
| **ETH** | L1 smart contract platform |
| **AVAX** | Alternative L1 |
| **SUI** | Next-gen L1 competitor |

## Unique Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **Network Stability**: Historical outages
- **Centralization**: Validator concentration
- **Clock Drift**: Timekeeping issues

### Market Risks
- **FTX Overhang**: Legacy association
- **Competition**: L2s and other L1s
- **Developer Churn**: Ecosystem retention

## SOL-Specific Analysis Notes

### Network Performance
- Monitor uptime and incident frequency
- Watch for congestion during high activity
- Track validator count and distribution

### Ecosystem Health
- DEX activity (Jupiter, Raydium)
- NFT marketplace volume (Magic Eden)
- Stablecoin flows (USDC on Solana)

### Meme Coin Activity
- SOL benefits from meme coin speculation
- Pump.fun activity drives network usage
- High correlation to meme cycle sentiment
