# BTC Research Focus

## Primary Narrative: Store of Value (Digital Gold)

Bitcoin should be analyzed through the lens of its unique position as:
- **Digital Gold**: Primary store of value in crypto, macro hedge thesis
- **Network Security**: Hash rate as proxy for network health and miner confidence
- **Institutional Vehicle**: ETF flows as leading indicator of TradFi adoption
- **Halving Cycle**: Supply schedule catalyst driving multi-year cycles

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Executive Summary Emphasis
- Lead with halving cycle position (days since/until, historical pattern)
- Reference ETF flow momentum (streak, magnitude)
- Compare to Gold performance (divergence/convergence)
- Cite MVRV Z-Score regime as primary valuation anchor

### On-Chain Valuation Priority Metrics

**Tier 1 (Must Include):**
| Metric | Bullish | Neutral | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| MVRV Z-Score | < 1.0 | 1.0-2.5 | > 3.0 |
| NUPL | < 0.25 | 0.25-0.65 | > 0.75 |
| Exchange Balance | Declining | Stable | Rising |

**Tier 2 (Context):**
- Realized Cap growth rate
- STH-MVRV (short-term holder valuation)
- Whale accumulation (1k+ BTC addresses)

**BTC-Specific Metrics:**
- Hash Rate: Network security proxy
- Miner Outflow Multiple: Selling pressure indicator
- Puell Multiple: Mining profitability stress

### Derivatives Positioning Focus

**Key BTC Considerations:**
- CME futures premium (institutional sentiment)
- Grayscale GBTC premium/discount (legacy indicator)
- Options skew (25-delta) for directional bias
- Open interest concentration by exchange

**Liquidation Analysis:**
- BTC has deepest liquidity - cascade risk lower than alts
- Watch CME vs offshore exchange positioning divergence
- Quarterly expiry (CME) creates predictable volatility windows

### Catalyst Analysis Priorities

**Near-Term:**
- CME/Deribit monthly options expiry (last Friday)
- ETF rebalancing windows (quarterly)
- FOMC meetings (direct risk asset impact)

**Medium-Term:**
- Halving countdown (if < 365 days)
- ETF approval milestones (new products, international)
- Corporate treasury announcements (MSTR, etc.)

**Regulatory:**
- SEC spot ETF decisions
- CFTC classification updates
- International regulatory frameworks

### Valuation Model Anchors

**Bull Case Triggers:**
- MVRV Z < 1.0 + Banana Zone active + ETF inflows sustained
- Historical: 12-18 months post-halving rally phase
- Target: Previous cycle high as reference (+adjustment for adoption)

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- MVRV Z 1.0-2.5 range trading
- ETF flows neutral to positive
- Macro neither strongly risk-on nor risk-off

**Bear Case Triggers:**
- MVRV Z > 3.5 + euphoric sentiment + macro risk-off
- ETF sustained outflows (> $500M/week)
- Regulatory enforcement escalation

### Risk Assessment Specifics

**BTC-Specific Risks:**
1. **ETF Structure Risk**: Custodian issues, fee compression
2. **Mining Centralization**: Geographic concentration post-China ban
3. **Energy Narrative**: ESG concerns, energy cost spikes
4. **Protocol Ossification**: Inability to upgrade (feature for some)
5. **Quantum Timeline**: Long-term cryptographic risk (10+ years)

**Invalidation Levels:**
- On-chain: MVRV Z > 4.0 historically marks cycle tops
- Technical: 200-week SMA as ultimate support reference
- Macro: Sustained risk-off (VIX > 30, HY spreads widening)

### Macro Context Priority

**BTC-Specific Correlations:**
- Gold: Lead/lag relationship (Gold leads ~6 months per Frendo)
- DXY: Historically inverse, but weakening (per Wu paper)
- M2: Strong positive correlation (liquidity proxy)
- Real Rates: Negative correlation (inflation hedge thesis)

**Halving Cycle Context:**
- Current position in ~4-year cycle
- Days since last halving / days until next
- Historical price action patterns (pre/post halving)
- Supply shock thesis status

### Technical & Sentiment Specifics

**Key BTC Levels:**
- 200-week SMA: Ultimate cycle support
- Previous ATH: Psychological resistance
- Round numbers: $50K, $100K, etc. (options gravity)

**Sentiment Indicators:**
- Fear & Greed with historical context (BTC-weighted)
- Google Trends for "Bitcoin" searches
- Social dominance vs altcoins

**Smart Money Signals:**
- Corporate treasury buying (MSTR, etc.)
- ETF flow direction and magnitude
- Whale wallet movements (> 1,000 BTC)
